# Issue Lifecycle

To ensure a balance between work carried out by the NGINX engineering team while encouraging community involvement on this project, we use the following issue lifecycle. (Note: The issue *creator* refers to the community member that created the issue. The issue *owner* refers to the NGINX team member that is responsible for managing the issue lifecycle.)

1. New issue created by community member.


2. Assign issue owner: All new issues are assigned an owner on the NGINX engineering team. This owner shepherds the issue through the subsequent stages in the issue lifecycle.


3. Determine issue type: This is done with automation where possible, and manually by the owner where necessary. The associated label is applied to the issue.
   #### Possible Issue Types
   `needs more info`: The owner should use the issue to request information from the creator. If we don't receive the needed information within 7 days, automation closes the issue.

   `bug`: The implementation of a feature is not correct.

   `proposal`: Request for a change. This can be a new feature, tackling technical debt, documentation changes, or improving existing features.

   `question`: The owner converts the issue to a github discussion and engages the creator.


4. Determine milestone: The owner, in collaboration with the wider team (PM & engineering), determines what milestone to attach to an issue. Generally, milestones correspond to product releases - however there are two 'magic' milestones with special meanings (not tied to a specific release):

   - Issues assigned to backlog: Our team is in favour of implementing the feature request/fixing the issue, however the implementation is not yet assigned to a concrete release. If and when a `backlog` issue aligns well with our roadmap, it will be scheduled for a concrete iteration. We review and update our roadmap at least once every quarter. The `backlog` list helps us shape our roadmap, but it is not the only source of input. Therefore, some `backlog` items may eventually be closed as `out of scope`, or relabelled as `backlog candidate` once it becomes clear that they do not align with our evolving roadmap.

   - Issues assigned to `backlog candidate`: Our team does not intend to implement the feature/fix request described in the issue and wants the community to weigh in before we make our final decision.

    `backlog` issues can be labeled by the owner as `help wanted` and/or `good first issue` as appropriate.


5. Promotion of `backlog candidate` issue to `backlog` issue: If an issue labelled `backlog candidate` receives more than 30 upvotes within 60 days, we promote the issue by applying the `backlog` label. While issues promoted in this manner have not been committed to a particular release, we welcome PRs from the community on them.

   If an issue does not make our roadmap and has not been moved to a discussion, it is closed with the label `out of scope`. The goal is to get every issue in the issues list to one of the following end states:

   - An assigned release.
   - The `backlog` label.
   - Closed as `out of scope`.
