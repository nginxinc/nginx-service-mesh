Before deploying NGINX Service Mesh in OpenShift, see the [Considerations]({{< ref "considerations.md" >}}) page, which highlights runtime and deployment considerations when using NGINX Service Mesh in OpenShift.

## Supported Platforms

Any self-managed RedHat OpenShift environment running with the versions listed in the [Technical Specifications]({{< ref "/about/tech-specs.md#supported-versions" >}}) can be used with NGINX Service Mesh. Externally managed environments such as Azure Red Hat OpenShift and Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS may work, though they are not officially supported.
