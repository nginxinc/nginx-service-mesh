### Git Issues

For NSM support or issues not addressed by documentation, please reach out
via the issues tab, [NSM Git Issues](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-service-mesh/issues).

We use issues for bug reports and to discuss new features.
Creating issues is good, creating good issues is even better.
Filing meaningful bug reports with lots of information in them helps us
figure out what to fix when and how it impacts our users. We like bugs
because it means people are using our code, and we like fixing them even
more. Please follow these guidelines for filing issues:

- Describe the problem. Include version of k8s, `nginx-meshctl version`, and what K8s platform. 
- Include detailed information about how to recreate the issue.
- Include relevant configurations, error messages, and logs.
- Sanitize the data. For example, be mindful of IPs, ports, application names, and URLs

## NOTE

Support for NSM is not currently available via traditional NGINX or F5
support channels. All support is through the community at [NSM Git
Issues](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-service-mesh/issues).
